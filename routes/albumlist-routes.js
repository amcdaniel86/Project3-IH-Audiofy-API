// in a pure express app w/o react or angular, to Create a New Albumlist or Object Instance, it involves a get route where a user sees a form to fill in information.
// then that form submits to a post route where the info is received and then a new instance is created.
// However, with an API and a REACT front end, we only need one route.. the POST route, no get route, since React takes care of the get route for us.
// The form the user will fill out will be in the React app, and we will have to retrofit the React app, so it can successfully make a post request using Axios to the post route we define below.

// second step is to make the routes file.

// postman will test the API, while we're building the app.
// to test: enter 0route into top bar for postman, and add keys and test to see if in the browser a new json object is added, edited, deleted, etc depending on route being tested.

// cross origin request security - cors needs to be installed as well.

// Check with Nick on Edit routes quick
// ALL ROUTES NEED TO BE TESTED

// req.body and body in postman is for post routes where all the key/values need to be included, like add-new or edit.

// req.params and params in postman are for times when id is used, one particular instance is grabbed from the database.
